# Boiler_Forecasting_ML_Models
This page contains the Python scripts used to develop forecasting models (MLP, RNN, GRU, LSTM) for an industrial boiler as part of my engineering undergraduate final year project.

Three Code Files:
  -MultilayerPerceptron (training and testing code and plotting code)
  -EncoderDecoderRNN (training and testing code)
  -DE_Simulation (optimisation and saving code)

Note that these jupyter notebooks have no outputs displayed, since information cannot be shared from the operational data.
